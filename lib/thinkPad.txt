We can likely make it so the widget exapnds in one direciton, i.e. when it grows, the pin point locatin does not change.
I'm guessing there is an easy widget for that. Probably some kind of tween (AlignmentTween)


To solve the multiple markers focused problem, we can store a value 'isFocused' in each marker
Every time the user clicks a marker, we iterate through the marker list until we find one with 'widget.isFocused = true'
Once we find one that isFocused and is not the current requested marker, we can flip the isFocused value and end the loop

----------------------------------------------------------------
I might be going about the defocusOldMarker stuff the wrong way
 
change IndividualMarker into a stateless class
destroy and rebuid the marker that we need to



----------------------------------------------------------------
map marker onPress: call provider function that toggles isFocused of current marker and old marker. Then destorys and rebuilds those markers
