We can likely make it so the widget exapnds in one direciton, i.e. when it grows, the pin point locatin does not change.
I'm guessing there is an easy widget for that. Probably some kind of tween (AlignmentTween)


To solve the multiple markers focused problem, we can store a value 'isFocused' in each marker
Every time the user clicks a marker, we iterate through the marker list until we find one with 'widget.isFocused = true'
Once we find one that isFocused and is not the current requested marker, we can flip the isFocused value and end the loop


On marker tap, search through marker list



HOW DO WE GET THE isFocused PROPERTY OUT OF THE WIDGET BUILDER

One idea would be to put the key and value of isFocused propery into a Provider
Iterate through that list, and find the key value that relates  to the Map Marker we need to unFocus
Then, iterate through the Markers list until you find the one with the right key.
the flip the isFocused propery
----- this seems like it is probably an unnecessary step. there's probably a way to do it while ONLY iterating over the Marker list
