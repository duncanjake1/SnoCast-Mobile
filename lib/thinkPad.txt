We can likely make it so the widget exapnds in one direciton, i.e. when it grows, the pin point locatin does not change.
I'm guessing there is an easy widget for that. Probably some kind of tween (AlignmentTween)


To solve the multiple markers focused problem, we can store a value 'isFocused' in each marker
Every time the user clicks a marker, we iterate through the marker list until we find one with 'widget.isFocused = true'
Once we find one that isFocused and is not the current requested marker, we can flip the isFocused value and end the loop

----------------------------------------------------------------
map marker onPress: call provider function that toggles isFocused of current marker and old marker. Then destorys and rebuilds those markers


----------------------------------------------------------------
put individual marker back into a statefull class
state will be used to make the marker grow and shrink

call a controller from the marker
the map marker controller or bulk controller will ultimately use the key from the marker to build the accident summary

We will need to restructure the bulk data to include a UID for each entry that matches the marker in each data entry
That way we can search the bulk data for the key, grab the data, and generate whatever we want from that.

we need to update the bulk data is fetched
	animation will end and map will show when bulkDataControllerProvider != null
